-> Java Virtual Machine is used to convert byte code into machine code.


3. What are the different types of memory areas allocated by JVM?
-> Heap, Stack, Method area.


4. What is JIT compiler?
-> Just in Time compiler is used to convert byte code into machine code at runtime, faster execution.


5. How Java platform is different from other platforms?
-> Java platform is different from other platforms because it compiles byte code which runs on JVM, thus independent of OS.


6. Why people say that Java is ‘write once and run anywhere’ language?
-> As java is compiled in byte code so any OS having JVM can run Java.


7. How does ClassLoader work in Java?
-> Loads class into memory during runtime.


8. Do you think ‘main’ used for main method is a keyword in Java?
-> No, main is just the name of the function whereas keywords are public, static and void.
 

9. Can we write main method as public void static instead of public static void?
